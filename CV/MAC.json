I love discovering new ways of doing things and spend a lot of my free time researching on my own. Although my professional career has been related to Backend development, DevOps and Frontend I've always researched new fields. I wouldn't understand development without that exciting research component.",

                "description": "I decided to move to **Switzerland** to work at **CERN**, as it presented a fantastic opportunity for my career advancement. My work at CERN focused on the **CERNphone project**, which aimed to replace Skype for Business by integrating it with CERN's telecommunication systems.\n\nI was fortunate that the pandemic began just six months after I arrived at CERN. As you can imagine, it was a unique professional and personal experience to have endured this historic and challenging time at such a remarkable institution. The team I had the privilege of working with was composed of highly responsible and friendly individuals. Thanks to their support, we were able to overcome challenges and maintain a high level of productivity. Our team successfully refactored, fixed, and restructured a project that had been reassigned to us by CERN management.\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a5bc546a-3617-46a4-9d3b-3a76d7b9ecc0/Untitled.jpeg)\n\nInitially, my primary responsibility was the development of the **CERNphone Desktop App** for macOS, Windows, and Linux using **Electron**. The client application utilized **React, Redux, WebSockets, and SIP.JS** as its main technology stack. The project also required a **Python-based REST API** to manage sessions and other services provided to the app, which was deployed in **OpenShift**. The system is now in production, replacing Skype for Business, and serves over 5,000 users while handling approximately 30,000 calls daily.\n\nIn addition to the desktop application, our team developed web services and daemons to manage the call system in a user-friendly manner. We employed **OpenShift, Docker, Python, and Flask** for the backend, and **React-Redux and TypeScript** for the frontend. Our choice of technology stack allowed for agile development, efficient testing, and the implementation of both development and production environments, following **DevOps** principles. During this time, I enhanced my **Docker skills** through hands-on experience with **OpenShift and Kubernetes**, as well as additional training.\n\nSubsequently, we began working on the **CERNphone mobile applications** for Android and iOS. My focus was on **iOS development using Swift**. This experience marked my first professional encounter with **Swift and the Apple Development Program**, providing valuable learning and practical insights into deploying software for real users.\n\nThis opportunity proved to be highly enriching, particularly regarding the work environment. I collaborated with **multicultural teams**, communicated in English, managed software requirements, planned and delivered solutions, and provided in-person support to end-users from around the world. I also had the chance to concentrate on a **Swift-based project**, applying best practices in software development that I had acquired up to that point. Upon leaving CERN, I ensured a smooth knowledge transfer and successful completion of the project I had initiated."
